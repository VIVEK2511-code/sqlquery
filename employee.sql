-- GROUP BY Clause in SQL
-- ðŸ”¹ Definition

-- The GROUP BY clause is used in SQL to arrange identical data into groups.

-- It is commonly used with aggregate functions such as:

-- COUNT() â†’ counts rows

-- SUM() â†’ total of values

-- AVG() â†’ average

-- MAX() â†’ maximum

-- MIN() â†’ minimum

-- Thus, GROUP BY helps to generate summarized reports from a table.

-- ðŸ”¹ Syntax
-- SELECT column_name, AGGREGATE_FUNCTION(column_name)
-- FROM table_name
-- WHERE condition
-- GROUP BY column_name
-- HAVING condition;


-- WHERE â†’ filters rows before grouping

-- GROUP BY â†’ makes groups

-- HAVING â†’ filters groups (like WHERE but works after grouping)
