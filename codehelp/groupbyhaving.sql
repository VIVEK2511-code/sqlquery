-- ðŸ”¹ Rule of Thumb

-- WHERE â†’ filters rows before grouping.

-- HAVING â†’ filters groups after grouping.

-- ðŸ“Œ Example Table: student
-- id	name	city	marks
-- 1	Vivek	Delhi	85
-- 2	Anita	Mumbai	90
-- 3	Rahul	Delhi	75
-- 4	Neha	Pune	88
-- 5	Arjun	Mumbai	70
ðŸ”¹ 1. Group students by city
SELECT city, COUNT(*) AS total_students
FROM student
GROUP BY city;


Output:

city    | total_students
--------|----------------
Delhi   | 2
Mumbai  | 2
Pune    | 1

ðŸ”¹ 2. Filter with HAVING
SELECT city, COUNT(*) AS total_students
FROM student
GROUP BY city
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;


Output:

city    | total_students
--------|----------------
Delhi   | 2
Mumbai  | 2


-- ðŸ‘‰ HAVING COUNT(*) > 1 removed Pune, since it only has 1 student.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Another Example (average marks per city, only cities with avg > 80)
SELECT city, AVG(marks) AS avg_marks
FROM student
GROUP BY city
HAVING AVG(marks) > 80;


Output:

city    | avg_marks
--------|----------
Delhi   | 80.0
Mumbai  | 80.0
Pune    | 88.0


ðŸ‘‰ Here, only cities with average marks greater than 80 are included.
