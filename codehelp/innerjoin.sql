What is an INNER JOIN?

An INNER JOIN returns rows that have matching values in both tables.

If there is no match, that row is excluded.

ðŸ“Œ Example Tables
student
id	name	city_id
1	Vivek	1
2	Anita	2
3	Rahul	1
4	Neha	3
5	Arjun	2
city
  
city_id	city_name
1      	Delhi
2     	Mumbai
3	      Pune
4	      Chennai
ðŸ”¹ INNER JOIN Example
SELECT student.id, student.name, city.city_name
FROM student
INNER JOIN city 
ON student.city_id = city.city_id;

âœ… Output
id	name	city_name
1	Vivek	Delhi
2	Anita	Mumbai
3	Rahul	Delhi
4	Neha	Pune
5	Arjun	Mumbai

ðŸ‘‰ Notice:

Only students with a matching city_id in the city table are shown.

If a student had city_id = 5 (not in city table), they would be excluded.

ðŸ”¹ Key Points

INNER JOIN = returns only matched rows.

Syntax:

SELECT columns
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
